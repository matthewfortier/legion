# legion
Legion is a cross-platform file searching utility designed with the developer in mind. Daunting codebases with hundreds of thousands of lines of code instantly made more manageable. Use of glob patterns for file searching and regex for containing text will be familiar to savvy developers and help them find the files and code they need.
